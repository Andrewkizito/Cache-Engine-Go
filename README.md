# Cache Engine Go

## Overview
Cache Engine Go is a personal pet project aimed at exploring and implementing caching mechanisms in Go. It serves as a lightweight and efficient caching engine, designed to provide fast and reliable caching capabilities for learning and experimentation purposes.

## How It Works
The project is structured to include core utilities for managing cache operations and server interactions. It leverages Go's simplicity and performance to create a caching solution that is both easy to use and efficient. The main components include:

- **Cache Utilities**: Core logic for managing cached data.
- **Server Utilities**: Basic server management tools to interact with the cache.

This project is a work in progress and is primarily intended for personal learning and experimentation.
